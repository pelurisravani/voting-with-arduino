Arduino Uno : Arduino/Genuino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.. You can tinker with your UNO without worring too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again.


We assumed push button as EVM. So when I push push buttong It'll count the number of times the button is pressed. If buttong is pressed Then it'll increment the number so It'll count number of votes we get. Finally By showing those we can get the total votes get by political party..
